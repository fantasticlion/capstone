Capstone for CSCI 1300 User Interfaces and User Experience
Responsive Redesign of the Website of Manhattanville College Library’s Page for Applied math, Math and Computer Science Websites


Description:

For my Capstone project, I redesigned the website of Manhattanville College Library’s page for applied math, math and computer science websites. I found several spaces for improvement from the original website (https://mville.libguides.com/c.php?g=370039&p=2500355):
The space on the right side of the Manhattanville College Library’s logo is not being used and the navigation bars are a little too small for the users to navigate.
The titles of each block of website links are not highlighted so it’s a little hard for users to navigate through each block of information.
There are many texts displayed on the page and the font size is a little small so it might be hard for users to find the information they need.

In my redesign, I made some adjustments to cater to these issues:
I put the navigation bar on the right side of the logo so that it can be made bigger and the space on the right side of the logo can be used.
I highlighted the title of each block of website links with color contrast and highlighted each block with a crimson color which is different from the color of the background and similar to the color of the library logo.
I removed the description texts under each website link and made the font size bigger so that it could be easier for users to navigate between them when looking for information.

All the functions of the original website are preserved. I also added color highlights for the navigation bars at the top and the bottom to make them more visible for users of the website, and I added pictures for each block of website links to make them more appealing to users and more intuitive to understand what the websites are about. I built this website using technologies including HTML, CSS, Git, and React.
